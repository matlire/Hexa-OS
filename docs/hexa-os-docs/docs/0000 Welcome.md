## Welcome to Hexa OS!

Hexa OS is a from-scratch project, which main goal is to create an os capable of running both - linux and windows executables.

Hexa OS was started as learning project in the first place. So it will be completely self-made, starting from kernel.

As Hexa is going to be a large project with lots of changes overtime I believe documentation is essential.
